SystemVerilog (4 parts)

  1. Logistics (compiler options, enable coverage)
  2. Build Covergroups, Build Coverpoints
  3. Constraint Randomization
  4. Interface 2 & 3 with your module (Check report)

// *** Shouldn't need more than 500 to 1000 clock cycles for all coverages *** //
  
//~~~~~~~EXAMPLE CODE BEGINS~~~~~~~~//
  
//-----Constraint Randomization-----//
class random_buy;
  rand int index;
  constraint c { index > 0; index <=4; }      //0-4 for 4 coins and a no coin signal
  // Want to create buy variable and constraint, but make sure you don't buy every cycle in order to meet requirements.
  // Therefore, have buy be something like [0, 0, 0, 1, 1]
  // Also want to create a random variable for buying a product [00, 01, 10, 11]

      *   The idea for this is that rb.index will go to an index in an array of sorts. The array will hold the serialIn values
      *   for penny, nickel, dime, quarter, and no input.
      *   Then a number for the corresponding coin code is pushed in each clock cycle, simulating the serialIn of a coin.
      *   Make sure to pad penny with 1's at the end to prevent possibility of confusion.
