How to get DC compiler to work:

SSH into: linux.engr.ucsb.edu
Create new folder "HW5_DC"
put counter.v into folder
put updated .synopsis_DC.setup into folder
run "dc_shell"


What i did after DC compiler worked:
dc_shell> read_file [name of counter file]
//stuff
dc_shell> link
//stuff
dc_shell> compile
//stuff
dc_shell> write -hierarchy -format verilog -output [make a name up for output file]
//1
dc_shell> report_area

//Report stuff you should screenshot (AREA REPORT)




Then:

Take gate level output file
take all of class.v and put in gate level output file

Create a miter w/ gate level and counter

make a testbench to test

Miter will never work because there is a delay in one of the files.




Turnin: Counter code + testbench
Counter waveform
Gate level output file
Area report
Waveform of miter? (Waveform of gate-level simulation/verification)
